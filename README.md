## Description

Team tracker is a node.js  command-line application that will take in input and generate cards for each team member on a development team.  I designed this app using an Employee class from which Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes inherit.  These classes have both properties and methods.  Each employee card lists the employee ID and their email.  The email is clickable and will open  your email app when clicked.  Depending on the job role it also displays different information.  The manager displays his/her office number.  The engineers also display a clickable link that will take you to their github page in another tab. And lastly interns display the school that they are attending.
